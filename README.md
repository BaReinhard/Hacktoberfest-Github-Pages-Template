# Hacktoberfest-Github-Pages-Template

No longer active!

This is a Repo to help with displaying multiple files in the repo onto a webpage. This has been used with a few repositories, [Mathematics](http://brettreinhard.com/Hacktoberfest-Mathematics) , [Data Structures and Algorithms](http://brettreinhard.com/Hacktoberfest-Data-Structure-and-Algorithms), [Arduino](http://brettreinhard.com/Hacktoberfest-Arduino).

The folder file structure to work with this template is as follows:
```
/general_folder/sub_folder/programming_language/file_name.lang
```
Example:
```
/data_structures/merge_sort/cpp/merge_sort.cpp
```
# Installation
Inside of your Github Repo clone this repo into the root directory (I prefer doing so in a webpage-build branch to not clutter the actual repo)
```
git clone https://github.com/bareinhard/Hacktoberfest-Github-Pages-Template
cd Hacktoberfest-Github-Pages-Template
./install.sh {Your Github Username} {The Repo To Be Used}
